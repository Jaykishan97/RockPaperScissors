How to Play
When the game starts, you will be prompted to enter your name. Once you have entered your name, you will be prompted to choose your move - rock, paper, or scissors. To make your move, simply enter the corresponding number (1 for rock, 2 for paper, or 3 for scissors) and hit Enter.

The computer player will then make its move, and the winner of the round will be displayed on the screen. The game will continue until one player has won three rounds.
